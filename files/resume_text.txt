Job 1: Data scientist, University of North Dakota
Location: Grand Forks, North Dakota
From August 2018 to Present
◦ Churn Prediction in Clinical Context: Design of machine learning model to detect patients with blood poisoning, sepsis, based on clinical data 6 hours earlier than a doctor. My paper and results are published in the CinC 2019 Conference in Singapore.◦ Deep Energy Retrofit: for my second paper, I worked on building a scalable machine learning model to predict energy consumption per building in different locations using python.◦ Technologies: Python, GitHub, Docker, Google Cloud, Parallel computing, ETL, Visualization, Linux


Job 2: Data scientist, BMCE Bank Of Africa Group
Location: Casablanca, Morocco
From Dec 2017 - June 2018
◦ Financial Risk Management: As a data scientist, I designed and deployed new machine learning system for Credit Default Risk and Credit Loss Evaluation. I accomplished performance of 80% for Credit Risk, and I achieved 90% for Credit Loss on some financial products and at least 70% on most of them. Resulted in cutting $1.0M in financial credit losses.◦ Credit Fraud Risk Management: I contributed to building an automated loan fraud detection system by conducting fraud cases assessment and audit and establishing a robust training and testing data.◦ Technologies: Auto-ML with H2O, Spark, R, Python, ETL programming, Shell scripting



Job 3: 
Data Scientist, OCP Group SA
Location: Casablanca, Morocco
From Feb 2017 - June 2017
◦ Predictive Maintenance: As a data scientist, I designed and deployed a machine learning system to predict failures of critical routing machines in the plant using R. Model performance achieved over 80%.◦ Technologies: R, R-shiny, Data Visualization with R, ETL programming
