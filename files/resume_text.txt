Job 1: Data scientist, University of North Dakota
Location: Grand Forks, North Dakota
From August 2018 to Present
- Churn Prediction in Clinical Context: Design of machine learning model to detect patients with blood
poisoning, sepsis, based on clinical data 6 hours earlier than a doctor. My paper and results are published in the
CinC 2019 Conference in Singapore.
- Energy Efficiency: for my second paper, I worked on building a scalable gradient boosting machine model to
predict energy consumption per building in different locations using python.
Skills and Technologies: Python, GitHub, Docker, Google Cloud, Parallel computing, ETL, Visualization, Linux


Job 2: Data scientist, BMCE Bank Of Africa Group
Location: Casablanca, Morocco
From Dec 2017 - June 2018
- Financial Risk Management: As a data scientist, I designed and deployed new machine learning system for
Credit Default Risk and Credit Loss Evaluation. I accomplished performance of 80% for Credit Risk, and I
achieved 90% for Credit Loss on some financial products and at least 70% on most of them. Resulted in cutting
$1.0M in financial credit losses.
- Credit Fraud Risk Management: I contributed to building an automated loan fraud detection system by
conducting fraud cases assessment and audit and establishing a robust training and testing data.
Skills and Technologies: Auto-ML with H2O, Spark, R, Python, ETL programming, Shell scripting


Job 3: Data Scientist, OCP Group SA , From Feb 2017 - June 2017
Location: Casablanca, Morocco
- Predictive Maintenance: As a data scientist, I designed and deployed a new system to predict failures events of
critical routing machines in the plant using R. Model performance achieved over 80%.
Skills and TechnologiesTechnologies: R, R-shiny, Data Visualization with R, ETL programming



Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL, C/C++, CUDA, Java

Tools: Google Cloud, Docker, AWS, Spark, Hadoop
